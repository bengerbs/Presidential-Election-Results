# Presidential-Election-Results

With the presidential election just over a month away, I created a Tableau dashboard that adds a fresh dimension to election data visualization. While many election maps focus on current results, this dashboard allows users to compare the latest presidential election outcomes with historical data—a feature that’s often missing in traditional visuals. My goal was to offer something deeper: a way to understand how political landscapes have shifted over time.

Unlike standard visualizations that emphasize real-time projections, this dashboard highlights past trends side by side with modern results. Users can not only see which party won each state, but also how decisive the victory was. The shading of each state provides an intuitive way to visualize the margin of victory, revealing whether a state was solidly won or hotly contested.

This interactive tool offers more than just a snapshot of history—it invites exploration. Whether you’re interested in seeing how a swing state has evolved over multiple elections or tracking the rise and fall of party dominance in different regions, this dashboard brings that data to life. It’s a resource for anyone wanting to dive deeper into election history and understand the patterns behind the political map.
